# SSI Console

The SSI Console aims to provide a seamless experience for issuers and verifiers in the SSI ecosystem. With the SSI Console, issuers and verifiers can create and manage their DIDs, credential issuance flows, and presentation exchanges all in one place. 

The SSI Console leverages the SSI Service API to simplify credential issuance and verification, and make both easy to do via a web interface.  

## Introduction

Orient users to the project here. This is a good place to start with an assumption
that the user knows very little - so start with the Big Picture and show how this
project fits into it. It may be good to reference/link the broader architecture in the
`collaboration` repo or the developer site here.

Then maybe a dive into what this project does.

Diagrams and other visuals are helpful here. Perhaps code snippets showing usage.

Project leads should complete, alongside this `README`:
* [CODEOWNERS](./CODEOWNERS) - set project lead(s)
* [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) - Fill out how to: install prereqs, build, test, run, access CI, chat, discuss, file issues

The other files in this template repo may be used as-is:
* [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)
* [LICENSE](./LICENSE)
